# lists
List data structures written in C

A Basic Linked List - List which simply adds nodes to the end of a list and iterates over the values of the list

A Singly Linked List - Similar to above but with additional functionality such as specific node insertion, deleting nodes, etc.

A Dynamically Linked List - Similar to Singly linked list but with navigation of the list from both ends.
